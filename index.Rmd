This is a discussion site for the use of the MinION in environmental sequencing at WHOI.

MinION equipment version ?
MinION chemistry v9.1? or 9.2

We were trying to sequence mRNA

Several issues we've had:
  Molecular Biology
    attaching old barcode kits has been a problem
  
  Data
    the MinION generates 1-2 million individual files, of different lengths
    these can be painful to move
  
```{r}
